Automated Brain Masking of Fetal Functional MRI with Open Data

Fetal_Functional_MRI_Segmentation is an open-source toolkit based on MONAI for brain extraction from fetal's function MRI files.

This program can be directly run in Google's Colaboratory
[![run in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Achillesy/Fetal_Functional_MRI_Segmentation/blob/master/fmri_vnet_interface.ipynb)
, allowing you to execute fetal brain segmentation code in your browser and:

  - no configuration required
  - only need to upload the fMRI file
  - the mask can be downloaded directly

----
![upload_guide](figures/upload_guide.png)
  - Run the program in Colab
  - Click the **Files** icon on the left
  - Click the **Upload to session storage** icon above
  - After uploading the fMRI files press the **Enter** key to continue
  - Rightclick to download results after a short wait
  - Don't forget to **refresh** the output file list
